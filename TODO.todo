X Add client-server shared code
X User screen and user configuration
X Major tidying up, avoid repeated code, best way to write tests 
X Harmonise/understand schema
X Gravatar, + Profile picture upload and S3 integration/filesystem?
X Finish login/user management properly

- Config/multihoming: App configuration, loaded at boot time AND Multihoming, app configuration becomes workspace configuration
- Load user settings on app load IF that is best practice and doesn't happen already
- More permissions (multihoming)

- Add a backend interface, explain how to make it work, what code to share
- Log server errors and client errors
- One (or more) of the "extra" stuff in the admin interface

- Add email system (SMTP?, Amazon?)
- AI integration
- Add socket infrastructure

Extra:
- Operational hygiene (structured logging, tracing, health checks, alerts)
- Security controls (rate limits, audit trails, rotation, dependency scans, pentests)
- Data handling (validation, encryption, retention/purge policies, backups)
- Testing & automation (CI, regression/e2e coverage, performance benchmarks)
- Observability (business metrics, uptime, capacity signals)
