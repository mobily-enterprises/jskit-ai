# JSKIT

Website: <https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/jskit-ai/>

This repository is the JSKIT monorepo.

## Node.js

Use Node.js 26 for repository development and publishing; `.nvmrc` records that default. Published JSKIT libraries and tooling support Node.js 22 from 22.12.0 onward, Node.js 24, and Node.js 26. Repository CI verifies all three supported majors. Newly generated applications require Node.js 26, record that runtime in their own `.nvmrc`, and use Node.js 26 in JSKIT-managed verification workflows.
